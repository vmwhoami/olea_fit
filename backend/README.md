# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project: Redesign of Twitter

> In this project I built Dance opinion application based on a redesign of Twitter.  

Some of the advanced concepts explored in this project includes.
- Working with advanced associations, many-to-many relationships, a typical twitter follow and follower relationship model.
- Basic Authentication using just username
- Used RSpec as the test suit with the help of shoulda-matchers and capybara for effective testing. Both unit and integration testing was done.
